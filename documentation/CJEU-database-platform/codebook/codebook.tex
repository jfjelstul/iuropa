\item[\code{proceeding\_number}] \code{numeric}\hspace{5pt}The number of the proceeding, used in \code{proceeding} and \code{proceeding\_id}.

\headerpage{procedures}{Legal procedures in CJEU decisions}{35}{12}

\subheading{Description}

This dataset includes information on legal procedures referenced in CJEU decisions. There is one observation per legal procedure per decision. There are many legal procedures, but the major ones are references for preliminary rulings, actions for failure to fulfill obligations, actions for annulment, actions for failure to act, damages for non-contractual liability, and appeals. The dataset indicates the ruling of the Court with respect to each legal procedure. For direct actions (all legal procedures except references for a preliminary ruling), the Court can rule that the plaintiff's application was successful, unfounded, or inadmissible. It can also issue an interlocutory ruling or dismiss the application.
